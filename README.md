# STM32L0-series HAL code examples

## Summary
This repo contains code examples based on the *Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)* provided by STMicroelectronics to support STM32 based boards using *STM32L0XX* MCU's series.

## Notes
* The Toolchain used to build the code is MDK5 V5.27.1.0

* The MCU and Nucleo board used to run these examples are the STM32L053R8 and NUCLEO-L053R8 respectively.

* You need to install the *software pack* for your *STM32L0XX* MCU in MDK5 using the "Pack Installer" module inside the toolchain.
