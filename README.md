# STM32L0-series

## Summary
This repo contains example code  based on the *Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)* provided by STMicroelectronics to support STM32 based boards using *STM32L0XX MCU's series*.

## Notes
* The Toolchain used tu build the code is MDK5 V5.27.1.0

* The MCU and Nucleo board used to run those examples are the *STM32L053R8* and *NUCLEO64-L053R8* respectively.

* You need to install the *software pack* for your STM32L0XX MCU in MDK5 using the "Pack Installer" module inside the toolchain.
